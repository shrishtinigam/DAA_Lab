Maximun value sub array using recursive algorithm
Consider an array


 of integers. Every subarray of 


 is assigned with a value, described as follows. Value of 


 is 


. In other words, Value of the subarray [âˆ’7, 3, 5, 4] is -


   which is  


  Design a recursive algorithm and an appropriate code  to compute the subarray of A which has the maximum value. If there are more than one subbarray whose value is maximum, your code should print all such arrays, one after the other, in the order of their size.  If there  are more than one  array with same size, whose values are maximum, then your code should print those subarrays in the order of their occurence in the given array. All the calculations are rounded off to two decimal format.

 

Input format :

Enter the length of the array :

Enter the elements of the array one after the other:

Output format:

Print the maximum value of the subarray:

Print all the elements of the subarray one after the other:
