Three subarrays of same length
Given an array A of integers, write a pseudocode and the appropriate code to modify the array A and output three subarrays A1,A2,A3, all of same length such that, elements of A1 is arranged in an increasing order, A2 is arranged in a decreasing order, A3 is arranged in an increasing order in such a way that when you combine A1, reversal of A2 and A3, we get the original array A in an increasing order. In case, if you are unable to have subarrays of same length, the first two subarrays should be of same length and the  size of  the last subarray will be with a different   length. If A =< 7,−3, 4, 2, 6, 0, 5 >, then A1 is < −3, 0 >, A2 is < 4, 2 >, A3 is < 5, 6, 7 >. Observe that the reversal of a subarray, say, <-3,1,5> is <5,1,-3>.

Input format:

Enter the length of array A:

Enter the elements of A one after the other:

Output format:

Output the elemnts of A1 one after the other:

Output the elemnts of A2 one after the other:

Output the elemnts of A3 one after the other:

Example:

Input:
