Compute the expression F(X) (20 marks)
A function f(x) is expressed as follows:


 

Here n is a natural number. Given x, n, Write a pseudo code and the corresponding code to compute f(x) using brute-force technique strategy and by using a divide-conquer-combine strategy. You have to write one code of which one component will be a brute-force strategy and the other component will be a divide-conquer-strategy. You have to separate these two components with ‘comments’ appropriately. The code should output the value of f(x) in a three decimal format. If x = 1, n = 3, f(x) is 0.862. You have to use ‘round-off’ for the purpose.

Input format:

Enter the value of n (a positive integer greater than 1):

Enter the value of x, a real number:

Output format:

Value of f(x) in brute-force strategy in a 3-decimal format:

Value of f(x) in divide-conquer-combine strategy in a 3-decimal strategy:

 

 

Example:

Input:

3

1

Output:

0.842

0.842
